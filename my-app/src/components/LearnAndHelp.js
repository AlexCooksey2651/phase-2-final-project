            <p>Be honest - when you think of sharks, do you think of intelligent, curious animals like the tiger shark in this video? Or do you think of ferocious, malevolent, man-eaters like the one in <em>Jaws</em> or countless other horror movies?</p>
            <p>For what it's worth, Peter Benchley - the author of <em>Jaws</em> (the book upon which the famous film is based) - came to regret how he portrayed these maligned creatures and became an activist for ocean protection. While sharks are indeed large predators, capable of aggression and violence, they are far more deserving of our respect and appreciation than our fear and revulsion. Now more than ever, they need our protection.</p>
            <p>Consider this: as of 2021, an average of 10 people are killed each year by shark attacks, and many attacks occur when humans provoke sharks through contact (such as touching a wild shark or hooking/netting one while fishing). By contrast, the Australian Institute of Marine Science reports that an estimated 150 people are killed each year by falling coconuts.</p>
            <p>While sharks kill approximately 10 people every year, humans are responsible for <em>100 million</em> shark deaths every year (some estimates are far greater). It's estimated that could be as much as 8% of the world's shark population killed on an annual basis.</p>
            <p>Many sharks are killed due to unsustainable (and often illegal) fishing practices. Sharks are often caught and killed as bycatch when other species are caught; however, the biggest contributor is the growing consumption of shark fin soup in countries such as China and Vietnam. Hunters will often chop their fins off before dumping the shark back in the water. They, like all other marine wildlife, also suffer from the impact of climate change and unsustainable pollution of the ocean environments.</p>
            <p>As apex predators, sharks are tremendously important to maintaining healthy marine ecosystems. These beautiful, graceful creatures have survived and kept watch over our oceans for more than 400 million years; with our help and conscientious protection, they can remain a fixture of the deep blue seas.</p>
            <h2>What Can You do to Help?</h2>
            <p>Here are some simple things you can do to help protect sharks and oceans as a whole:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Learn more about sharks!</b> Fear of sharks often comes from misunderstanding. If you want to help protect sharks, understanding them is a great first step.</li>
                <li>Switch from single-use plastics such as water bottles, straws, silverware, and shopping bags to reusable options. Always recycle plastics when possible.</li>
                <li>Support sustainable fishing practices when purchasing seafood. Check out the resources like the Monterey Bay Aquarium's <a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/">Seafood Watch.</a> <em>Please do not consume shark fin soup!</em></li>
                <li>If you live near a coastline, consider volunteering for debris removal events. The Ocean Conservancy hosts the world's largest volunteer cleanup on behalf of ocean health: the <a href="https://oceanconservancy.org/trash-free-seas/international-coastal-cleanup/">International Coastal Cleanup</a></li>
                <li>Reach out to your family, friends, and even your elected officials to help protect the oceans and sharks! One person can make a difference; spreading the word helps that much more.</li>
            </ul>
